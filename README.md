# Reddit_writing_prompts_parser

# Purpose
This parser enables you to generate adjectives regarding a certain noun or adverbs regarding a certain verb. It looks at the comments of the top 50 posts of all-time in r/WritingPrompts (this number may be changed by going to line 36 and modifying the "limit=50" to the number of posts you'd like to parse through).
